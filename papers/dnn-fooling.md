### What is the Problem?

Despite the near-human-level performance that DNNs have shown in image processing, large differences exist between computer and human vision: changing an image in imperceptable way to human could result in a DNN labeling the image as something else entirely. We say that under certain circumstances the DNNs are easily "fooled."
